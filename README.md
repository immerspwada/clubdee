## Membership Approval Flow

The system implements a comprehensive membership approval workflow that ensures proper vetting of athletes before they can access the system.

### Overview

The membership approval system is **club-based**, meaning athletes apply to join a specific club (sport type), and coaches assigned to that club review and approve applications. This ensures proper organization and prevents athletes from accessing features before being properly vetted.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Application Submission (Athlete)

**What happens:**
- Athlete registers account (creates `auth.users` and `profiles` record)
- `profiles.membership_status` automatically set to `'pending'`
- Athlete navigates to `/register-membership`
- Selects a **club** (e.g., "Basketball Club", "Football Club")
- **Cannot select a specific coach** - assignment happens on approval
- Fills in personal information (name, DOB, contact, emergency contact)
- Uploads required documents (ID card, medical certificate)
- Submits application

**Database changes:**
```sql
INSERT INTO membership_applications (
  user_id,
  club_id,           -- Selected club
  status,            -- 'pending'
  applied_at,
  -- NO assigned_coach_id yet
  -- NO reviewed_by yet
);
```

**Business rules enforced:**
- ✅ Cannot submit if already have pending application
- ✅ Cannot submit if already have approved application
- ✅ Must select a valid club
- ✅ Must provide all required information

#### 2. Coach Review (Coach)

**What happens:**
- Coach logs in and navigates to Applications page
- Sees **only applications for their assigned club** (RLS enforced)
- Cannot see applications from other clubs
- Reviews athlete information and documents
- Makes decision: Approve or Reject

**Database query (RLS enforced):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM membership_applications
WHERE club_id = (
  SELECT club_id FROM profiles 
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'coach'
)
AND status = 'pending';
```

**Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies prevent coaches from seeing other clubs' applications
- Even if coach tries to manipulate API, database blocks unauthorized access

#### 3a. Approval Process

**What happens:**
- Coach clicks "Approve"
- System performs atomic transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Update application
UPDATE membership_applications SET
  status = 'approved',
  assigned_coach_id = [coach_id],
  reviewed_by = [coach_id],
  reviewed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = [application_id];

-- Update athlete profile
UPDATE profiles SET
  membership_status = 'active',
  coach_id = [coach_id],
  club_id = [club_id]
WHERE user_id = [athlete_user_id];

COMMIT;
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Athlete can now access dashboard
- ✅ Athlete assigned to approving coach
- ✅ Athlete assigned to selected club
- ✅ Notification sent to athlete
- ✅ Athlete appears in coach's athlete list

#### 3b. Rejection Process

**What happens:**
- Coach clicks "Reject"
- **Must provide rejection reason** (required field)
- System performs atomic transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Update application
UPDATE membership_applications SET
  status = 'rejected',
  rejection_reason = [reason],
  reviewed_by = [coach_id],
  reviewed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = [application_id];

-- Update athlete profile
UPDATE profiles SET
  membership_status = 'rejected'
WHERE user_id = [athlete_user_id];

COMMIT;
```

**Result:**
- ❌ Athlete cannot access dashboard
- ✅ Athlete can see rejection reason
- ✅ Athlete can submit new application (reapply)
- ✅ Notification sent to athlete with reason

#### 4. Access Control (Middleware)

**Single Source of Truth:** `profiles.membership_status`

The middleware checks this field on every request:

```typescript
// Middleware logic
if (path.startsWith('/dashboard/athlete')) {
  const profile = await getProfile(user.id);
  
  if (profile.membership_status !== 'active') {
    // Redirect to pending approval page
    return redirect('/pending-approval');
  }
}
```

**Status meanings:**
- `'pending'` → Cannot access dashboard, see "Pending Approval" page
- `'active'` → Full access to athlete features
- `'rejected'` → Cannot access dashboard, can reapply
- `null` → New user, needs to apply

### Key Design Principles

#### 1. Single Source of Truth
- **`profiles.membership_status`** is the authoritative field for access control
- All access decisions based on this field
- Updated atomically with application status
- Prevents inconsistencies

#### 2. Club-Based Organization
- Athletes apply to **clubs**, not individual coaches
- Coaches are assigned to clubs
- Coaches only see applications for their club
- Ensures proper organization and security

#### 3. Atomic Transactions
- All status changes happen in database transactions
- Application status and profile status updated together
- Prevents partial updates and inconsistencies
- Rollback on any error

#### 4. Security by Default
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforces access control at database level
- Coaches cannot bypass security to see other clubs
- Athletes can only see their own applications
- Admins have override capability

#### 5. Clear Status Flow
```
null → pending → active (approved)
              ↘ rejected (can reapply)
```

**No other transitions allowed:**
- Cannot go from `active` back to `pending`
- Cannot go from `rejected` to `active` without new application
- Status changes are one-way and audited

### User Roles and Permissions

### Permission Enforcement

**Database Level (RLS Policies):**
```sql
-- Example: Coaches can only see their club's applications
CREATE POLICY "coach_view_own_club_applications"
ON membership_applications FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  club_id IN (
    SELECT club_id FROM profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'coach'
  )
);
```

**Application Level (Middleware):**
```typescript
// Middleware checks membership_status for athletes
if (profile.role === 'athlete' && 
    profile.membership_status !== 'active') {
  return redirect('/pending-approval');
}
```

**API Level (Server Actions):**
```typescript
// Server actions verify permissions before operations
export async function approveApplication(id: string) {
  const coach = await getCoachProfile();
  const application = await getApplication(id);
  
  // Verify coach owns this club
  if (application.club_id !== coach.club_id) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  }
  
  // Proceed with approval...
}
```

### Key Features

- **Club-Based Applications**: Athletes apply to clubs, not individual coaches
- **Coach Isolation**: Coaches only see applications for their club (enforced by RLS)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Athletes cannot have multiple pending applications
- **Atomic Updates**: All status changes are transactional to prevent inconsistencies
- **Rejection Feedback**: Coaches must provide reasons for rejection
- **Reapplication**: Rejected athletes can submit new applications
